# Poetry-Classification

Give this program two or more names of german poets and it will scrape their poems from www.deutschelyrik.de, clean and vectorize the texts and save them on disk. 
It will then return a predicted artist (from the ones that have been given before) for any line of text.

The model used is a Naive Bayes model with random oversampling.
